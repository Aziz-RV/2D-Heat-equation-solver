 - src: which contains the codes and the cmakelists.text

 - build: here we have two subfolders:
 
        1. results: This folder further contains two folders both of which are explained in the readme file inside the folder itself.
        2. testdirichlett_references_data: Here we have the csv files that are used by the test_dirichlett.cpp in order to compare the 
            the numerical solutions to the actual solutions and run the convergence test.
