- heat_equation_app_solutions: At the moment, this folder only contains a matlab sciript. This matlab script plots the results on a 2D grid obtained after running heat_equation.cpp in the src folder. This matlab script takes mesh.csv and numerical_solution.csv as inputs, both of which are generated by the heat_equation.cpp file.

- test_dirichlet : This folder contains the results of the test_dirichlett.cpp (This includes 4 different meshes, the corresponding solution vectors stored in different files "sol_1/2/3/4.csv". These files are created when the user runs TEST_dirichlet executable). This is provided with a matlab plotting file, in case the user wants to plot each of the solutions with corresponding meshes. 

- test_neumann : This folder contains the results of the test_dirichlett.cpp (This includes 4 different meshes, the corresponding solution vectors stored in different files "sol_1/2/3/4.csv". These files are created when the user runs TEST_dirichlet executable). This is provided with a matlab plotting file, in case the user wants to plot each of the solutions with corresponding meshes.
