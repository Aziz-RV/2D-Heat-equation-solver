This is the readme file for testdiricheltt_references_data

- In this directory we have 4 csv files that are used by the test_diricheltt.cpp file.
- The csv files contain the reference solution vector, each corresponding to a different mesh-size.

- The test_diricheltt.cpp file computes the 2-norm error between the real solution (reference) and the numerical solution
    for decreasing mesh-size.
