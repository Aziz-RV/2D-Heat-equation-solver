# 2D-Heat equation solver

The project is about writing a solver for steady state solution of 2D heat equation.  
Since the steady state solution is time independent, the pde reduces to Poisson equation with right hand side as zero (Laplace equation) and that is what we solve in this project.  
We make use of the finite difference method for solving this.  
We plot our solution using Matlab and compare our results to the solution to analytical result.
